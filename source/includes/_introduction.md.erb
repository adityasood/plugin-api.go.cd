Plugins, as the name implies, help in extending the functionality of GoCD. GoCD publishes a list of extension points for
which plugins can be provided. An extension point published by the GoCD - defines the interface and the lifecycle that
governs the respective plugin. At present only Java based extension points and plugins are supported by GoCD, but the
interface is simple enough for anyone to build plugins in other languages using a simple HTTP bridge.
