# Analytics Plugins

## Current Version

This document is for version 2.0 of the analytics endpoint.

## Introduction

The Analytics endpoints are GoCD extensions which allow plugins to embed external analytics directly into GoCD. The Analytics endpoint complements the [Notification endpoint](../notifications/), allowing visualizations and insights into the metrics collected using the Notification endpoint and from other sources.

GoCD provides a placeholder on the pipeline dashboard for plugins to display their pipeline level analytics. Apart from this, GoCD also provides a global analytics dashboard which can be leveraged by plugins to visualize analytics at a global level.

If you're looking to start right away with a basic template for analytics plugins, we recommend forking this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/analytics-skeleton-plugin).
